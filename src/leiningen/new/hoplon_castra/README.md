# {{name}}

A [Hoplon][4] project with Castra[2] designed to...well, that part is up to you.

## Dependencies

- java 1.7+
- [boot][1]

## Usage
### Development
1. Start the `dev` task. In a terminal run:
    ```bash
    $ boot dev
    ```
    This will give you a  Hoplon development setup with:
    - auto compilation on file changes
    - audible warning for compilation success or failures
    - auto reload the html page on changes
    - Clojurescript REPL


2. Go to [http://localhost:8000][3] in your browser. You should see "Hello,
Hoplon and Castra!" with random numbers that are generated on the server and
transmited to the client. But you should change that to what you want.

3. To use the Clojurescript REPL on another terminal run:
    ```bash
    $ boot repl -c
    ```
    ```clj
    boot.user=> (start-repl)
    ...
    cljs.user=> (.alert js/window "From the Clojurescript REPL")
    ```
    You should see a popup on the browser.

4. If you edit and save a file, the task will recompile the code and reload the
   browser to show the updated version.

.### Production
1. Run the `prod` task. In a terminal run:
    ```bash
    $ boot prod
    ```
2. The compiled files will be on the `target/` directory. This will use
   advanced compilation and prerender the html.
