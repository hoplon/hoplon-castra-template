    - auto reload the html page on changes
    - Clojurescript REPL

2. Go to [http://localhost:8000][3] in your browser. You should see "Hello,
Hoplon and Castra!" with random numbers that are generated on the server and
transmited to the client. But you should change that to what you want.

3. If you edit and save a file, the task will recompile the code and reload the
   browser to show the updated version.

.### Production
1. Run the `prod` task. In a terminal run:
